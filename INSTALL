Requirements to compile and install tdu:
	
	- gcc
	- GNU Make (other makes are not guaranteed to work)
	- ncurses (including header files)
	- glib 2.0 (including header files)
	- pkg-config

To install the above on a Debian GNU/Linux system:

	apt-get install gcc make libncurses5-dev libglib2.0-dev pkg-config

What you need to do:

	1. type: make
	2. type: make install

What the above steps do:

	make
	- compiles the C source code and builds the tdu executable.
	make install
	- installs the executable as /usr/local/bin/tdu
	- installs the manpage as /usr/local/man/man1/tdu.1

If you do not wish to install into /usr/local, then instead of a simple "make
install" you can install to a different installation path via one of the
following:

	make install prefix=/usr

	# if you have the GNU Stow package installed
	make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/tdu
	cd /usr/local/stow
	stow tdu
