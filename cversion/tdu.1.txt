       tdu  is  a  program that displays disk space utilization as reported by
       du(1) in an interactive full-screen folding outline.  tdu displays  the
       space taken by each directory, including all its descendents.  The user
       can navigate the tree structure and  open  (or  close)  directories  in
       order  to  display  (or  hide)  the  utilization of subdirectories (and
       files, if du -x is used) within each directory.   The  entries  can  be
       sorted by filename or space utilizied, or reverted back to their origi-
       nal sorting order.

       q, x, Control-C, Escape
              Exit the tdu program.

       Up, Down, Home, End, PgUp, PgDn
              Navigate through the directories and filenames being  displayed.

       <, >   Keys that perform the same functions as Home and End.

       Control-N, Control-P, Control-B, Control-F
              Emacs bindings that perform the same functions as the arrows.

       h, j, k, l
              vi bindings that perform the same functions as the arrows.

       Right  If the cursor is located at a directory, shows immediate descen-
              dents of that directory.  If Right is pressed many times in suc-
              cession,  opens the tree to display as many levels of descending
              directories and filenames.

       1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
              Open the current node to display 1 to  9  levels  of  descending
              directories ans filenames.

       *      Display all levels of descendents of the current node.

       Left, 0
              If  the  cursor  is  located  at  a  directory, hides all of its
              descendents from the display.

       p      Move the cursor to the current node's parent.

       s, S   Sort the direct descendents of the current node in ascending (or
              descending) order of size.

       n, N   Sort the direct descendents of the current node in ascending (or
              descending) order of filename.

       u, U   Re-sort the direct descendents of the current node in the origi-
              nal order (or its reverse).

       = then s, S, n, N, u, or U
              Perform one of the above sorting operations recursively.

       Control-L
              Move  the current node to the center of the screen as closely as
              possible.

       Control-R
              Refresh the entire display, incase it has been clobbered.

       -h     Display a summary of command-line options.

       -A     Use ASCII characters instead of line-drawing characters.

       -G group-name and -I pattern
              The "-a" option of du(1) is used to obtain usage information  on
              all  files,  not just directories.  These options lump filenames
              within a directory into groups in order to display their collec-
              tive disk utilizaion.  Groups are displayed as fake directories,
              and individual filenames within those groups can still  be  dis-
              played.

              "-G  group-name"  is specified first, then multiple "-I pattern"
              options can be specified to group files matched  by  those  pat-
              terns into the group-name.  Patterns can contain the "?" and "*"
              wildcard characters, which respectively match exactly one or any
              number of characters in a filename.

              Additional groups of -G and -I options can be specified.

              The  first  pattern  that each filename matches determines which
              group into which the filename is classified.

       du -ax | tdu -G 'BACKUP FILES' -I '*~'  -I  '#*#'  -G  'POSTSCRIPT'  -I

              Collectively displays usage for all backup files in a particular
              directory  under  the  name  "BACKUP  FILES", and all PostScript
              files under the name "POSTSCRIPT".
