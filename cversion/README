tdu is a text-terminal program that displays disk space utilization in an
interactive full-screen folding outline. Branches of the tree may be hidden or
displayed, and files/directories in a branch can be sorted by filename or
total space utilized.

tdu uses the ncurses library to interact with the terminal; unlike most disk
usage visualization programs, it does not require the X Window System. It is
therefore ideal in situations where you're logged in to a remote Unix system
and for various reasons you do not wish to run an X program such as xdu
remotely or copy the output of du over the network.

Like the classic xdu utility, tdu does not traverse a directory tree computing
disk usage itself; it requires a program such as du to provide that
information.
