WHAT IS TDU?

tdu is a text-mode disk usage visualization utility.  When used in conjunction
with the du(1) utility, tdu displays an interactive full-screen tree that you
can expand and collapse if you wish to check the utilization of subdirectories
(and files, if you run du with the -a option).

The manpage, tdu.1, provides more detailed documentation, including
keybindings and command-line options.

REQUIREMENTS

- Perl 5.8.4 or greater.  May or may work with earlier versions of Perl.
- The Curses Perl module.

INSTALLATION

If your perl is not located at /usr/bin/perl, modify the first line of the tdu
program accordingly.

Then just type: make install
	- Copies the tdu program into /usr/local/bin.
	- Generates the manpage, tdu.1, and copies it to
	  /usr/local/share/man/man1.
	- I'm too lazy to set up autoconf.

Don't want /usr/local?  Try one of the following:
	make install prefix=/usr
	make install prefix=$HOME

To install via GNU Stow:
	mkdir /usr/local/stow
	make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/tdu
	(cd /usr/local/stow && stow tdu)
